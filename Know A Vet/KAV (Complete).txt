<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in becoming a part of the KnowAVet.org Website Team! To help us make the best choice from the applicants for HTML Editor, we ask that you complete the Sample Assignment described below. If you decide that this is not the kind of volunteer work you're interested in doing, simply let us know.</p>
<p>The HTML Editor position on our team will edit legacy content on our website as part of the site-wide effort to present a consistent style. The only software you will need is a text editor.</p>
<p>As HTML Editor, it's important that you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Understand basic HTML and CSS constructs</li>
	<li>Follow specific instructions for each assignment</li>
	<li>Ask any questions you may have to clarify the instructions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Assignment</h2>
<p>Every assignment will be presented in this format. Follow the instructions below, then return this file to me (rick@knowavet.org).</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>In this exercise, follow the instructions below in cleaning up <a href="https://www.knowavet.org/choosing-a-medical-service-provider/" target="_blank">this content</a> on our website. The goal on all assignments is to strip out the irrelevant content, leaving only the HTML tags. The legacy content (from previous editors) contains a lot of mark-up that is inconsistent with our style guide and overrides our CSS with inline styles.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of what you'll need to clean-up in this assignment:</p>

<p>1. Change this...</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Costs</b><b>- </b>Be aware of when they want payments and how much you will need to pay...</span></p>
<p>to this:</p>
<p>Costs - Be aware of when they want payments and how much you will need to pay...</p>

<p>2. Change this...</p>
<ul>
	<li data-leveltext="o" data-font="Courier New" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2"><span style="color: #000000;">Family physicians </span></li>
</ul>
<p>to this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Family physicians</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Remove the bullets from these lines: "Costs", "Location", "Specialists", and "Availability" and add the H2 tag, followed by the text for each in paragraph tags. EXAMPLE:</p>

<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>Be aware of when they want payments and how much you will need to pay if there is need to use a doctor, hospital, specific medical service or a specialist that is out of the plan. Search around to choose the best provider according to your needs and budget. Ask about payment plans, discounts (senior, veterans, etc.) and other payment assistance if you are worried you cannot afford the service.</p>
