<h1>HTML Editing Assignments</h1>
<p>John, here's your next assignment.</p>

<h2>Style Guide Basics</h2>
<p>Here are a few rules from my style guide that apply to all topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>All subheadings in a topic should be tagged H2. Occasionally, we may have a use for H3.</li>
<li>Use initial caps for all words in H2 subheadings, except for articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.<br /><strong class="editor">Example</strong></li>: "Veterans Celebrate a Day to Remember and More"</li>
<li>Use initial caps for the first word in a bulleted list.</li>
<li>Avoid use of the ampersand (&) character, unless it's part of a title or a proper noun.<br /><strong class="editor">Exception Example</strong></li>: "Bed Bath & Beyond Files for Bankruptcy"</li>
<li>In general, we have no use for SPAN tags. Remove them.</li>
<li>Most bulleted lists, like this one, are unordered. Only procedural lists should be ordered (numbered) lists.</li>
<li>All links that take the user off-site should include the target="_blank" attribute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for This Assignment</h2>
<p>You'll be editing the HTML source for the <a href="https://www.knowavet.org/taxes/" target="_blank">Taxes</a> page.</p>
<p>Let's plan on a few passes through the content. On the first pass, remove the image at the top, remove ALL the inline styles, span tags, and heading tags. Leave the strong tags in place. Attempt to find a replacement for the broken links. If there is no replacement, just remove the link, but leave the descriptive text. Change all https protocol to https.</p>

<h2>Start Here - IRS - Special Tax Consideration for Veterans</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/military/special-tax-considerations-for-veterans" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/individuals/military/special-tax-considerations-for-veterans</a></p>
<p>Disabled veterans may be eligible to claim a federal tax refund based on: an increase in the veteran's percentage of disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs (which may include a retroactive determination) or the combat-disabled veteran applying for, and being granted, Combat-Related Special Compensation, after an award for Concurrent Retirement and Disability. To do so, the disabled veteran will need to file the amended return, Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, to correct a previously filed Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ. An amended return cannot be e-filed. It must be filed as a paper return. Disabled veterans should include all documents from the Department of Veterans Affairs and any information received from Defense Finance and Accounting Services explaining proper tax treatment for the current year. Please note: It is only in the year of the Department of Veterans Affairs reassessment of disability percentage (including any impacted retroactive year) or the year that the CRSC is initially granted or adjusted that the veteran may need to file amended returns. Under normal circumstances, the Form 1099-R issued to the veteran by Defense Finance and Accounting Services correctly reflects the taxable portion of compensation received. No amended returns would be required, since it has already been adjusted for any non-taxable awards. If needed, veterans should seek assistance from a competent tax professional before filing amended returns based on a disability determination. Refund claims based on an incorrect interpretation of the tax law could subject the veteran to interest and/or penalty charges."</p>
