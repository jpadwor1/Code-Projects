<h1>HTML Editing Assignments</h1>
<p>John, welcome to the team! Here's your next assignment.</p>

<h2>Style Guide Basics</h2>
<p>Here are a few rules from my style guide that apply to all topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>All subheadings in a topic should be tagged H2. Occasionally, we may have a use for H3.</li>
<li>Use initial caps for all words in H2 subheadings, except for articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.<br /><strong>Example</strong>: "Veterans Celebrate a Day to Remember and More"</li>
<li>Use initial caps for the first word in a bulleted list.</li>
<li>Avoid use of the ampersand (&) character, unless it's part of a title or a proper noun.<br /><strong>Exception Example</strong>: "Bed Bath & Beyond Files for Bankruptcy"</li>
<li>In general, we have no use for SPAN tags. Remove them.</li>
<li>Most bulleted lists, like this one, are unordered. Only procedural lists should be ordered (numbered) lists.</li>
<li>All links that take the user off-site should include the target="_blank" attribute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for This Assignment</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.knowavet.org/before-during-and-after-a-medical-appointment/" target="_blank">Before, During and After a Medical Appointment</a> page is what you'll be editing for this task. Note the strike through on the broken links when you view the page in your browser. Remove the broken links and re-word the content when necessary.</p>
<p>This task is much like the Sample Exercise. One thing in this content that you'll see a lot is the double use of URLs. We want only the named references used in HREFs, not the duplicates that show only the URL. For example, see the "Sources" section at the end of this topic.</p>
<p>Create H2 headings where you think they're needed.</p>

<h2>Content for This Editing Assignment</h2>

<p>Going to an annual physical or going to an ongoing care appointment, most of us have walked out with unanswered questions.
