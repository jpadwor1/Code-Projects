<h1>HTML Editing Assignments</h1>
<p>John, here's your clean-up next assignment, <a href="https://www.knowavet.org/getting-to-the-doctor/" target="_blank">Getting to the Doctor</a></p>

<h2>Style Guide Basics</h2>
<p>Here are a few rules from my style guide that apply to all topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>All subheadings in a topic should be tagged H2. Occasionally, we may have a use for H3.</li>
<li>Use initial caps for all words in H2 subheadings, except for articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.<br /><strong class="editor">Example</strong>: "Veterans Celebrate a Day to Remember and More"</li>
<li>Use initial caps for the first word in a bulleted list.</li>
<li>Avoid use of the ampersand (&) character, unless it's part of a title or a proper noun.<br /><strong class="editor">Exception Example</strong>: "Bed Bath & Beyond Files for Bankruptcy"</li>
<li>In general, we have no use for SPAN tags. Remove them.</li>
<li>Most bulleted lists, like this one, are unordered. Only procedural lists should be ordered (numbered) lists.</li>
<li>All links that take the user off-site should include the target="_blank" attribute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for This Assignment</h2>
<p>By now, I think you understand how this HTML clean-up works, so I won't say much beyond this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Change the bold bulleted text to h2 headers.</li>
	<li>Leave the YouTube video links as they are.</li>
	<li>Remove Article Sources at the end.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content for This Assignment</h2>

<!-- Introductory Content -->

<p> 
	I hang up the phone, unable to think of anyone else to call. Each person I had talked with said they were busy. Don't they realize I can't just hop on a bus or drive myself?  Don t my friends care? I groan in frustration.  My next treatment appointment is tomorrow, and I have no way of getting to it.
</p>
<p> 
	My doctor told me it is important not to miss any scheduled treatments. Shouldn't getting to treatment be part of the treatment, I ask myself. I don t want to, but I ll have to cancel. Again.
</p>

<p>
	For Veterans, the largest barrier to healthcare access is transportation (per 2021 VHA iEX conference [video]). It affects over 5 million Veterans.
</p>
<p>
	Transportation barriers can lead to poor health outcomes. Worsening chronic illness, loss of care continuity, and rehospitalizations increase. The VA and other groups help Veterans overcome transportation barriers. They offer a range of services for a variety of circumstances.
