<p> 
    Whether unemployed, underemployed, or seeking a career change, it’s helpful to know that some organizations offer free skills training to Veterans.
    
    Such organizations respect the service and sacrifices made by Veterans, and the traits that make Veterans great additions to civilian work teams. They know the value that military experiences in leadership, technology, missions, planning, and workload management bring to civilian employers.
    
    In addition to free skills training, these organizations provide support services, interview training, and job placement help. A few offer ‘earn while you learn’ opportunities.
    
    In this article we offer information on 6 programs providing free training to eligible Veterans.
